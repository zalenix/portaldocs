# Design Guidelines

These design guidelines provide solutions for common scenerios in Azure.  In Azure, we formalize these best practices once several teams have a similar problem, use a well researched shared approach, and see successful real-world usage of the common solution. Azure teams should leverage these design guidelines to accelerate extension development and to provide users with a familiar experience so that users can easily adopt new Azure services.

## Resource management patterns
The resource management patterns provide guidance for managing the full lifecycle of Azure resources.

* Create a resource [design-patterns-resource-create.md](design-patterns-resource-create.md)

* Browse resources [design-patterns-resource-browse.md](design-patterns-resource-browse.md)

* Manage a resource [design-patterns-resource-manage.md](design-patterns-resource-manage.md)


## Page 
The page patterns provide guidance for common page layouts in Azure

### Page design recommendations
* Pages should be full screen so that we do not displaying partial pages and avoid horizontal scrolling
* Each page that is displaying data should have a **Refresh** command

### Page patterns

* Full screen [design-patterns-page-fullscreen.md](design-patterns-page-fullscreen.md)

* Responsive pages [design-patterns-page-responsive-design.md](design-patterns-page-responsive-design.md)

* Page with lists [design-patterns-page-grid.md](design-patterns-page-grid.md)

* Forms [design-patterns-page-forms.md](design-patterns-page-forms.md)

* Filtering [design-patterns-page-filtering.md](design-patterns-page-filtering.md)


## Design toolkits and resources
Design toolkits and resources are available so that you can easily create designs that leverage these patterns

* Design toolkits [design-patterns-toolkits.md](design-patterns-toolkits.md)

* Style guide [design-patterns-style-guide.md](design-patterns-style-guide.md)

* Icons [design-patterns-icons.md](design-patterns-icons.md)

* Writing guides - key resources to brand voice and content style and standards for Azure and the Business Applications Group within the Cloud + AI division. These two guides supply quick answers and essential direction for anyone who creates content — whether for brand naming, product design, documentation, marketing, PR, events, or other customer communications.
