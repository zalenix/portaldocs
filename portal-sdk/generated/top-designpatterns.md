# Design patterns for common Azure scenarios

These design patterns provide solutions for common scenerios in Azure.  In Azure, we formalize these best practices once several teams have a similar problem, use a well researched shared approach and see successful real-world usage of the common solution. Azure teams should leverage these design patterns to accelerate extension development and to provide users with a familiar experience so that users can easily adopt new Azure services.

The following patterns are available
